        "description": "JetLovers app helps you to track flight history via several ways. Besides adding flights manually, you can connect your social profiles such as Swarm/Foursquare and continue making check-ins at the airports via that service. JetLovers then pulls all those check-ins and if they fall under certain criteria, flights will be created automatically, which is a unique feature. Historical imports are also supported, so if you are active user of Swarm you can create an account and see your flight map or even 3D globe via several clicks. Currently the range of functions is quite simple but we hope to continue development with the help of your support (check our patreon page).",
